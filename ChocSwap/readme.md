# Choc hotswap designs

Various designs (some WIP or abandoned) for handwired Choc hotswap keyboards.

## Completed designs

### [Hotswap test](hotswap-test.stl)

Initial experiment for fitting hotswap sockets and trying out regular Choc vs [CFX](https://chosfox.com/collections/low-profile-keycaps/products/chocfox-cfx-choc-keycaps) spacing.

### [Hollow board](hollow-board.stl)

Similar to the other "board" designs, but made hollow to save time designing and rendering. Needs to be printed with supports, but only where touching the build plate.

### Ortho

[Ortho basic](ortho-4x10-basic.stl) & [ortho surround](ortho-4x10-surround.stl) are ortholinear designs with 1.5u thumbs. This [scad](ortho.scad) file is parametric allowing easily changing the size, keycap surround, and others. It will split the case into two parts that can be printed flat on the build plate without needing support.
